#### Payoff Matrix
Player A (along row), Player B (along column)

	      |  C    |   D   |
	|-----|---------------|
	|     | (R,R) | (S,T) |
	|  C  |       |       |
  	| --- |---------------|
	|     |       |       |
	|  D  | (T,S) | (P,P) |
	| --- |---------------|

For purpose of demonstration let, 
`T = 5, R = 3, P = 1 and S = 0`
